# About Me

I am Giuseppe, a Robotic Engineer interested in autonomous machines, algorithms and software. I am currently working at the Autonomous System Lab (ETH - ZÃ¼rich).

# About This WIKI

Partially started as a way to learn a bit about front-end development and automation. Hopefully helpful to someone looking for a concise collection of Computer Science notes. Feel free to leave a comment!

### Important Note

The notes are not reviewed and might contain error. I will try to keep them up to date and reviewed according to the comment. Some material is extracted from online courses and Introduction to Algorithms (CLRS). Use at your own risk!

### Thanks

This blog is heavily based on [this project](https://github.com/ArnaudValensi/ArnaudValensi.github.io) blueprint.
